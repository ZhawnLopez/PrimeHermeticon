Two accounts to use if you dont want to login / register in the site.
It'll automatically save your account login info and automatically do it for you if you do login.
The site will keep redirecting you to login or register if you logout and try to enter back to the pages
Trying to checkout while logged out will not work. You can still add to cart, but this wont save.

The two accounts for login are:

sonic@themovie.com
sonicsonic
(Customer acconunt)

mario@supermario.com
mariomario
(Fake/test admin account)

(Admin wont do anything yet, I'll send a proper admin account through the PrimeHermeticon teams channel)
